## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I really tried not to aim for a pixel perfect solution this time so that I don't waste too much time. However, I still feel like the paddings and margins for the mobile version is different to that of the desktop version which really annoys me. But I did the layout correctly anyway which is supposedly what matters.

### Continued development

I want to continue to work of flex-box as it seems to me that I am still not fully comfortable with it.
